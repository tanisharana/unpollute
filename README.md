Android app that has one functionality - user spots something, for instance, garbage being burnt in open air, open app, take a picture. A description of the picture is then sent to a central repository where the details of the event are stored and displayed on a hosted web site. The app must have minimal controls, it is to be designed to report pollution flashpoints on the go. Once the picture is taken, you need to identify the chief elements / objects in the picture, generate a basic description from the identified objects, and send description and geo location to a central server hosted on the cloud. This server is maintained by us. In a pilot run, the app is to be tested on 15-30 android phones . The data collected is sent to a visualization tool (via the cloud server) to show pollution hotspots on a map to identify (geopolitical) zones that need better administration.
